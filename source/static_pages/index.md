## Welcome!

The American Art Collaborative (AAC) is a consortium of 14 art museums in the United States. The Collaborative believes that Linked Open Data offers rich potential to increase the understanding of art by expanding access to cultural holdings, by deepening research connections for scholars and curators, and by creating public interfaces for students, teachers, and museum visitors.

This simple demonstration application lets you browse among the institutions' data that was provided for the AAC.
